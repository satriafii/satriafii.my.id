	<h2 id="for-you">For You,</h2>
<p>If you see this (i think you won&rsquo;t),</p>
<p>you should know that i can&rsquo;t get you out of</p>
<p>my head.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s fine, i enjoy it.</p>
<p>Stay healthy, stay lovely, and</p>
<p>i love you.</p>
<p>Really, i love you.</p>
<p>-Cit</p>
<h2 id="10th-of-may-2024">10th of May 2024</h2>
<p>I know I wrote this to someone else. But never sent it to them. Sorry for the disappointment, but that is the truth. I never know that I love the feature that mirroring myself at them, so I just love them.</p>
<p>In fact, I love myself more than I could realised back then. Now I just&mdash;- you know, accepting my love for myself.</p>
<p>Sounds cringe, but this is the way I grow. And I will continue to make this way on track and make it beautiful to look back.</p>
<p>Actually I feel bad to them who I love because I like their traits(???) that mirroring me. Like how they dress similar as me, how they talk like me, how they even answer some questions like me, I like that. But that is just me loving (and really badly expressing it) myself.</p>
<p>I always see myself clearly through other&rsquo;s eyes. But now, right now, I see myself clearly with my own eyes.</p>
<p>That is a big change.</p>
<p>I know that I should thank them to make me realize about that. But I don&rsquo;t want to let them know about this truth. The truth that I did like them and the truth that I like them because they similar as me???? What the actual fuck? Who does that???</p>
<p>Hahahaha</p>
<p>Feels like a narcissist if I explain it this way. But how can I describe it in other way?</p>
<p>Anyway, I now love myself more than before and I can say that out loud even more than before.</p>
<p>I believe that this kind of feeling is going to improve as I get older,</p>
<p>so for my future self, how is it going? Are you even more loving yourself? Are you proud of this version of yourself?</p>
<p>See you then.</p>
