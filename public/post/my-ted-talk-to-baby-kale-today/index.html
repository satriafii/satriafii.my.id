<h1>My TED Talk To Baby Kale Today - H(you)uman</h1>

<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Today you are 7 days old, guys. You have bigger body than you are at 3 days old. Oh my, did you even remember that day? It feels so long ago, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t want to talk about you at 3 days old. I as human, have some more experience than you. So I will share some of it.</p>
<p>Introducing this new poly bag filled with soil and fertilizer. This is your new place. It is a soil, a much bigger and much more soil than you have in the seedling place. They are just so old for you. You need more soil and more space to grow. You&rsquo;re guys are growing bigger everyday, don&rsquo;t you guys notice it?</p>
<p>I did, tho.</p>
<p>So here I am gathering all of the soils that I know and make sure they are fill the small poly bags. They have the responsibility to be your new home. It is your only home for some times, so I&rsquo;ll make sure that you have enough nutrients that you need to eat. More than that, I&rsquo;ll also make sure that you have enough water to drink on. Don&rsquo;t you guys worry about that.</p>
<p>You may don&rsquo;t understand why you should have a new place if you good with your old place and your friends around you.</p>
<p>Okay, in short, it is personal space.</p>
<p>You may don&rsquo;t really understand about that, but humans do. And humans thinks that you really need that sort of things. Personal space, personal time, and such.</p>
<p>Okay, I will explain it to you clearly.</p>
<p>If you have personal space, you will have more food available to you. Just yourself. You thirsty? Drink this much of water for yourself. Not even a single friends of you will bother about that. Because your friends also have their own personal space. Now, what if you feel lonely while you in your own personal space?</p>
<p>No need to worry.</p>
<p>Humans known as problem solver. We have those problems too. But we solved it. We now have phone. It is just a square machine that enables us to make friends even we have personal space. Even if the personal space of your friends is across this box. I don&rsquo;t really know much how it works, but I know how to make the things working for me.</p>
<p>You can just make a call to your friends, and they will accompany you when you&rsquo;re lonely. What if they not lonely enough to accompany you? Well, you call another friends. That goes as long as you find your right friends.</p>
<p>Now, how to know that friend you&rsquo;re calling is different friend? Well, it is a problem that human never encountered before the phone-system developed. So, human finds another solutions.</p>
<p>See, human&rsquo;s very&hellip; Fascinating.</p>
<p>We human have one problem at first. And then we have solution. Let&rsquo;s call it problem one solved by solution one because it will get complicated. Eventually, the solution one is something that brings another problem. So, we solved the solution one&rsquo;s problem with solution two. And we have two problems. And I won&rsquo;t type it all along. But you got the idea. If not, just read it through. It is not that important of a reading anyway.</p>
<p>What are we at again?</p>
<p>Oh yes. Calling friends and another friend.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>The solution is you make your friends number. Or. They can have their own number if they want to have the same phone-system as you are. And you also have to have your own number. It is called phone number. That phone number is different from names. Because names can be the same.</p>
<p>Number may be the same, but not as much as name.</p>
<p>So why have name, you say? Well, just because name are&hellip; aesthetique?? (with French sexiness insert)</p>
<p>Maybe? Me as a pretty new human just know that every humans need a name to call each other and when it comes to talking with far-away-friends, we need numbers.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>So, that is it guys for today&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Happy 7 days of your life.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy your new place.</p>
<p>And I hope you happy as well even if you don&rsquo;t have phone or numbers yet.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, you will always be baby kale for me.</p>
<p>And see you again when you&rsquo;re adult.</p>
<p>(So I can eat you)</p>
<hr>
<p>This is roughly real transcript of how I gave them Talk this evening.</p>
<p>They seems happy, anyway. So, don&rsquo;t worry.</p>
<p>Really, I talk to them in English like this and about this too. I think this is an interesting raw idea, so I just dump it here and make it as a blog post.</p>
