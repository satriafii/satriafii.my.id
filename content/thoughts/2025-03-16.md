what is it about death and grief related books? I *always* choose to read those without even knowing what is it about....

So I'm reading The Curious Kitten at The Chibineko Kitchen. It is a Japanese translated novel talking about people who face grief and helped at Chibineko Kitchen. The kitten was just a cherry on top, but yeah.
