Hello, my name is satriafii. I am a writer, not that I have a book published, but I consider myself as a writer because I write everyday. This is my home in the internet and also the way I can publish anything I want. Here I proudly build my own home and fill it up with some writings about what I learn, create, and grow. As a generalist, I get interested in a lot of stuff. Most of the times, I learn about learning, behaviour, web-dev, and many other topics that I just jump in and out. In my free time, I like to create something that I can use for myself, I mainly make books by bookbinding, clothes or any cute stuff with crochet and knitting, more also other random stuff. Fiction is something that I passionate to consume and create, so I also post a lot about books that I read and some fictions that I squished out of my brain. As a human being, I love to watch myself, plants, and animals grow. Side note about my posts, I like to write in different languages as long as I'm in the mood for. I tag it [ID] if it is in Indonesian, [EN] if it is in English, [JV] if it is in Javanese, and [KOR] if it is in Korean.

If you have some thoughts to share or anything to talk with me, you can [email me](mailto:heysatriafi@gmail.com) or [DM me at X](https://x.com/satriafii) (rarely open it, but I try to look at it once in a while).

Thank you for reading this intro until this part, I hope you have a good day.
