Welcome to this little corner on the internet.

This is the place where I put [my thoughts](/thoughts/), [cool photos](/photos/), [stuff that I make](/creations/), [things that I enjoy and not enjoy](/consumptions/), and [longer writing about anything](/post/).

I write anything in some languages randomly due to my multilangual brain work. Mostly I write in Indonesian and English. 

Some stuff that I did and I think these worth to look at to know more about me:
- [My photos page, it is so simple but functional and I think it's pretty hehe](/photos/)
- [PDF dan ePub Buku-Buku Domain Publik Indonesia](/post/kumpulan-buku-domain-publik-indonesia/)
- [Bahagia hanya Efek Samping](/post/bahagia-hanya-efek-samping)
- [Dark side of the cave](/post/can-i-just-die/)
- [Darker side of the cave](/post/i-scare-me/)
- [My thoughts because maybe you still remember how twitter work](/thoughts/)

What I do nowadays:
- [Read Books, I track here](/consumptions/)
- [sendirian](/post/loneliness-kill-you/)
- Create some crochet and knitting garments, here my [Ravelry page](https://www.ravelry.com/people/satriafii) where I track most of my Work In Progress.

You can talk to me [here](https://x.com/satriafii/) or [email me](mailto:heysatriafi@gmail.com).
