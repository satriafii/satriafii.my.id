### Crochet Bandana

*20 Oktober 2024 - 23 Oktober 2024*

Handmade bandana made by hand with green, white, and yellow yarn. The pattern is from Studio Knitâ€™s youtube video with simple stitches and easy to follow instructions. I made it a little different from the pattern using 4 mm and 2.5 mm hooks and adding leaf to spice the things up. I also adjust the length of the bandana as my liking.
