# My first micro crochet and beads crochet bracelet

*24 March 2025 - 24 March 2025*

This is my first time to crochet with lae yarn (i use nylon yarn actually) and beads. In this one project, I try two different new things, but the product really looks good. [I talk more about it here.](/post/my-first-micro-crochet-bracelet)
