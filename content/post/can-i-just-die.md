I think I shouldn't 

But I feel like it


Have a lot of projects still going on

But have no happy feelings lying around


Have a lot of time to spare

But just have tears to share


Have a lot story to tell

But it's just sadness and some not ending stories


Want to listen to friends

But have only busy and kind friends (i don't want to see them listen to my sadness)


Want to hug people that have sad face

But I'm too cold to hug anybody


I scream just to make someone hear how much pain I hold.

But the world is too hot, the ice just melt and nobody sees the tears.
