I speak 3 languages actively: Javanese most of the times, Indonesian when I write mostly, and English when I consume content and engage with it.

As Indonesian who is Javanese, I have the advantage to be bilingual since I can speak and understand the world. Eventually I know (and have to) English in school. I just fascinated by learning and do the homework at first. But I finally realized that I love to know something that most of people around me don't know. So I learned English more serious and became used to it.

I enjoy consuming content in English and I unknowingly acquire the language by myself.

Sometimes I don't understand the meaning of a word and still manage to emjoy the sentence or even the whole book. Sometimes I know all of the words used, but have no idea what is the sentence talking about.

Recently I have my freelance job. It is US based company so I have like **have** to use English more than I ever did before. And here I am, doing my best to improve my English by writing the whole article in broken English ðŸ˜€

But I am proud of myself.

I won't compare myself to others, but as a kid, I always envy my friends who able to attend some extra paid classes to just learn English and some other *essential* subjects. I have no money to pay that then. But now everything is in the internet. You can learn anything as long as you can access the internet. 

I learn how to understand English more, I learn how to make books by myself, I learn how to knit amd crochet, I even learn how to understand more languages by my own from the âœ¨internetâœ¨ 


As someone who spend less time on the internet than anyone in my age, I feel really lucky to know those things first and take this path. It is sooooo worth it to understand basic English first before you dive into the internet. It is also so helpful to be a little bit adult before you fall into the internet. And it is so wonderful to be able to find positive things in the internet.

I still learning. In fact I want to learn forever. So this openness of the world really help this little curious mind of mine to content with informations. 

I know, sometimes it feels really hard to get through a day with a bunch of informations that flood in these days. But the thing is, I have my own source to filter those information out. To pick just what I need and throw away (and be dumb about) the things that I don't need. 

As my father said a long time ago, "People need something to know and to not know. People also need something to remember and something to forget."

Right now, I love to know about personal growth, literature, languages, writings, crochet, knittings, bookmaking, learning, and some other things. I have a lot of things that I don't know, like wedding traditions, price of McDonald's ice creams, branded items, cars, and more other things. Not trying to be pick me or whatever people nowadays call it, but I genuinely don't care about those things. If you care about that, good for you and maybe you can talk about it with me too. Maybe just to educate me about that stuff ðŸ˜€

Okay, this thing is getting longer than I thought would be.

If you read this post until here, congratulations, you almost get to the point. This is the point of what I want to talking about:

Learning a new language is opening a whole new world for you.

It is clichÃ©, but that is the truth. I will never be able to write this whole post if I never learn a single word in English with so much effort. That is obvious, but you got the point. 

Right now I'm enjoying my time learning some other languages like Korean, German, Japanese and Chinese. But I have different idea about "learning" a new language now. For me, learning new languages is just me want to show off to people that I can understand and speak in that language and be proud of myself. That is why I just want to do the "learning" process joyfully. Not really *serious* like what I did with English. I want to jump into the shortcut: acquire the languages.

I know now that I don't have to remember what grammar that I use right now just to write a post about learning languages. I just have to do it with really basic vocabulary that I have and the most important thing to have: **CONFIDENCE**. 

You will never know that I used auto spelling so much in this post until I told you. I just wrote and wrote and it become a long post. You can't even make comments about what I said here, because I don't open a discussion, I just want to write and publish. That is the type of confidence I (and you) need if you want to be better at new languages. Just do it. Right now.


But yeah-- I think I have my progress right here, writing my blog post entirely in English.

Good day!
