I read this in Libby, I read the English version, so I want to write the review in English.

This is a short story collection from Cho Nam Joo (초남주), who write Kim Jiyoung, born 1982. I never read her works before, but I have the urge to read this one, because of the cover hehehe

There is 8 stories here, all of them are story about woman, for woman, and to woman. There is a woman with her sisters and waiting for her end in Under The Plum Tree. A writer who have her struggle and happiness by talking about woman in Dead Set. 

A woman who never really there in the story but she's there and make quite a scene in Miss Kim Knows make me wonder, is that a woman always potrayed? She's not here, but she make a lot of scene. She's cooking but  we only see her cleaned dishes. She is working, but we only see her finished works. We never see how she did things. But the things are finished, by her.

A girl who is super innocent will eventually woke up and sent some letter like Dear Hyunnam Oppa. And when she meet some other good girls, they will became the women as in Night of Aurora. But they need to grow up, despite how cruel the world is. They *need* to make a scene like in the Grown-Up Girl. 

The sweetest story goes to Puppy love 2020. Well, it is bitter sweet actually. It is about.... puppy love hehehehe.

My personal favourite is Runaway. 

>I am sorry to say that the rest of  the family is doing just fine without Father. It seems Father is also doing just fine without his family.

>-- *Runaway by Cho Nam Joo*

The story follow a youngest of the family, she is the only girl. Out of nowhere, her father suddenly dissapear. Weirdly, by the dissapearance of the father, the family often gather just to find a way to find their father. The quote I quoted above is the best part that I love. It is potraying how her father is just enjoying his life and thus, the family too. 

It is not like the father is someone who doesn't take his responsibility to his family. In fact, he is the most responsible man ever existed in a story. He served food, he tackled al of the mundane tasks for his family, he respect his wife, he got to the retirement with just rest, and he really take care of his family with love. 

But maybe, just maybe, he just found that he want to live his life fully. So he *runaway* from his family. In the end, the family just do as usual, but with a lot more gathering in the family home. 

And yes, they are doing just fine without the father. And the father also doing just fine without his family.

How lovely that is. 

For me, that is the highest kind of love. You can just let them go if they want to and welcome them if they go home. You can live as content as they here when they're not here. Because you love their soul, not just their body or image or face. You love them as they are. 

And I love you like that. Whoever you are. 

Have a good great day!
