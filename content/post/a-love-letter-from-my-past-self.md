I know I wrote this to someone else. But never sent it to them. Sorry for the disappointment, but that is the truth. I never know that I love the feature that mirroring myself at them, so I just love them.

In fact, I love myself more than I could realised back then. Now I just---- you know, accepting my love for myself. 

Sounds cringe, but this is the way I grow. And I will continue to make this way on track and make it beautiful to look back.

Actually I feel bad to them who I love because I like their traits(???) that mirroring me. Like how they dress similar as me, how they talk like me, how they even answer some questions like me, I like that. But that is just me loving (and really badly expressing it) myself. 

I always see myself clearly through other's eyes. But now, right now, I see myself clearly with my own eyes.

That is a big change.

I know that I should thank them to make me realize about that. But I don't want to let them know about this truth. The truth that I did like them and the truth that I like them because they similar as me???? What the actual fuck? Who does that???

Hahahaha

Feels like a narcissist if I explain it this way. But how can I describe it in other way?

Anyway, I now love myself more than before and I can say that out loud even more than before. 

I believe that this kind of feeling is going to improve as I get older,

so for my future self, how is it going? Are you even more loving yourself? Are you proud of this version of yourself?


See you then.
