Udah kepikiran dari beberapa hari yang lalu dari aku nulis ini sih (25 Juni 2023). Tapi baru berniat nulis sekarang. And now I'm ready to share this to the beautiful and ugly world hhehee :smile:

> I have someone who love me and I also have someone who hate me. What a perfect life! I have everything.
> 
> The corn cooks perfectly: some corn popped beautifully, some corn not. I have everything!


Hehehehhehehehe.

I know that's sound ridicoulus. But I love the idea.


Have a perfect day :kissing_heart:
