Have no idea what I want to talk about.


A lot of duty that I left behind just to make sure that I have a healthy looking eyes (without any sign of sadness or sober). One of the duty I left is writing. 


Honestly, everyone can check on how I'm doing mentally with how often they see me write. Recently, I just write random things without any reason. But I don't really write about my problems. I just let the feelings fleeting inside my head and my heart. I don't use my hand to put it out and actually make an effort to solve the problems.


Here I am. Don't have any life to live in. 


I just woke up, get some work done, eat, take one or two showers, and sleep again.


A friend asked me, "How are you doing today?"


I can't help but think, "I'm doing nothing." as an answer. But I can't even let that out.


Today, it is the same nothing that I have.


But I am content enough. 


I hope no one else have a nothing day.


Because everyone has to grow.


Ah, I guess today isn't nothing. I wrote this. So, I grow a little bit.


See you on my next growing time.
