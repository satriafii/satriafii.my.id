I just want to share some good applications that I know and use on everyday basis. 

My life is basically just screens, that's why I just want to share with the world hehe.

## Amusements

Hehehee, the first thing that I do at my phone is amuse myself with voices, visuals, and texts.

### Voices

- Musicolet to play downloaded songs (I download it illegally through telegram)
  This music app is something that I really love recently, the most helpful feature is this app allows us to temporary save some queue. I really love the built in lyrics display too.
